## Simulation of LPC2138 Projects Using Proteus and Keil Software
Welcome to the LPC2138 projects page! Here, we provide simulations of various LPC2138 microcontroller projects using Proteus and Keil software. These simulations are designed to demonstrate how the projects should function before physical implementation.

You can find all the necessary files for each project, including the source code and Proteus simulation files. Additionally, we’ve included screenshots of the simulations (both code and Proteus) to help you visualize the setup and results.

For detailed guidance on coding with Keil and designing simulations with Proteus, visit my YouTube channel [insert link here]. Don’t forget to subscribe for regular updates and tutorials!
